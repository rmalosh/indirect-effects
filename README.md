Indirect effects of influenza vaccine in households with children

The specific aims of this project are to:
1. Estimate the indirect and total effects of influenza vaccination in reducing influenza infection.
2. Estimate the indirect effect of influenza vaccination in reducing the risk of exposure to influenza within the household.
3. Estimate the indirect effect of influenza vaccination in reducing the risk of influenza infection in unvaccinated members following introduction of influenza to the household.

Updates on progress:
Aim 1 - analyses complete for indirect and total effects, analysis in progress for direct effects.
Aim 2 - analysis not yet started
Aim 3 - analysis not yet started

Additional aim - summarize the  existing research on herd and indirect effects with ASM and JLZ
